# Iot-Based-Patient-Health-Monitoring-System-Using-ESP-32-Web-Server
IoT-based healthcare system using ESP32 integrates MAX30100, DS18B20, and DHT11 sensors for real-time health monitoring. It provides analytics for remote management and early detection of health issues, ensuring accurate, continuous data tracking and enhanced patient care.

Components and Its details


1. MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor


The sensor is integrated pulse oximetry and heart-rate monitor sensor solution. It combines two LED’s, a photodetector, optimized optics, and low-noise analog signal processing to detect pulse and heart-rate signals. It operates from 1.8V and 3.3V power supplies and can be powered down through software with negligible standby current, permitting the power supply to remain connected at all times.

2.DS18B20 Temperature Sensor


This is a pre-wired and waterproofed version of the DS18B20 sensor. Handy for when you need to measure something far away, or in wet conditions. The Sensor can measure the temperature between -55 to 125°C (-67°F to +257°F). The cable is jacketed in PVC.
